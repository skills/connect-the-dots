In this course, you've learned a lot about finding and sharing information. Within a GitHub repository, you can find history about what changes were made, and more importantly, _why_ changes were made.

### What's next?

You can enable GitHub Pages and see `docs/index.html` as a website!

1. Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `REPONAME` with your GitHub repository name in `docs/index.html`.
1. Under your repository name at the upper right, click :gear: **Settings**.
1. Then on the lower left, click **Pages**.
1. In the **GitHub Pages** section, select `main` in the **Select branch** drop-down menu and `/docs` in the **Select folder** drop-down menu.
1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Wait about 30 seconds then refresh the page. When you see "Your site is published at ...," you can click on the link to see your published site.
